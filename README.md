### My name is Jonas (not the Weezer song)

I'm a software engineer (he/him) at [https://madewithlove.com](madewithlove) and I like my processes lean, my code tested and my feedback early. 
While rocking out to the Beatles, I'm teaching kids to play basketball, adults to write better software and people in general to be kind to each other.
